"""
Placement objects for Phase 1 headless engine.

PlacementObject — an ObjectClass with static/nav-point flags (parent of Waypoint)
Waypoint        — named position/orientation marker used by PlaceObjectByName
Waypoint_Create — factory that registers the waypoint in the global name registry

PlaceObjectByName resolves names through _waypoint_registry, a module-level dict
keyed by the waypoint identifier string.  All waypoints created via Waypoint_Create
are automatically registered here.
