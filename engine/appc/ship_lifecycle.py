"""Pub/sub for ship lifecycle events.

Subscribers receive ``("added", ship)`` when a ShipClass is inserted into a
set via SetClass.AddObjectToSet, and ``("destroyed", ship)`` when
ShipClass.SetDead transitions False -> True. The hub also maintains a
``_live`` set so late subscribers can call ``snapshot()`` to bootstrap.

The hub is engine-side and UI-agnostic. Subscribers manage their own
lifetime via the unsubscribe handle returned by ``subscribe``.
``reset()`` clears ``_live`` for mission swap; subscribers persist.
