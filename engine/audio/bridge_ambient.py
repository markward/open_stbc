"""Bridge ambient loop: the "AmbBridge" 2D looping sound that plays
while the player is on the bridge.

Mirrors sdk/Build/scripts/LoadBridge.py:213-217 which sets
AmbBridge.SetLooping(1) and Play() at bridge load time. We start/stop
on view-mode toggle from host_loop's bridge-side-effects sync rather
than at load time, so the sound is silent in the space scene.
