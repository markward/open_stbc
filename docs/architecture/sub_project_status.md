# Phase 2 Sub-Project Status

Phase 2 of the open_stbc rebuild (the C++ engine replacing `Appc.dll`) is
broken into sub-projects, each with its own design spec under
`docs/superpowers/specs/`. This file is the long-term index of what's done,
in flight, and what remains; it survives across spec revisions and points
into the spec docs for full context.

## Renderer sub-projects (item-by-item from the renderer breakdown)

| # | Sub-project | Status | Spec | Deferred-work tracker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | NIF loader | Implemented (v1 ship gate met 2026-05-09) | [2026-05-08-nif-loader-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-nif-loader-design.md) | (closed at v1; no backlog) |
| 2 | Asset pipeline | Implemented (v1 ship gate met 2026-05-09; 99 tests passing including end-to-end Galaxy.nif smoke) | [2026-05-09-asset-pipeline-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-asset-pipeline-design.md) | [§ Deferred / future work](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-asset-pipeline-design.md#deferred--future-work) + [`native/src/assets/docs/deferred_work.md`](../../native/src/assets/docs/deferred_work.md) |
| 3-6 | Renderer host (combined: scene-graph + minimal renderer + CPython embedding + skybox pass) | Implemented (v1 ship gate met 2026-05-09; 17 host+tools pytest cases passing including end-to-end M1 Basic mission load + 5-tick render smoke) | [2026-05-09-renderer-host-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-renderer-host-design.md) | [`native/src/host/docs/deferred_work.md`](../../native/src/host/docs/deferred_work.md) |
| 3-6+ | Ship controls (movement-only keyboard input) | Implemented (2026-05-09; player flies the Galaxy via Q/W/E/A/S/D + 0–9 + R) | [2026-05-09-ship-controls-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-ship-controls-design.md) | (folded into renderer-host's `deferred_work.md`) |
| 3-6+ | BC light data interpretation (Python-script lighting) | Implemented (2026-05-10; 1 ambient + up to 4 directionals; v1 ship gate Galaxy still lit via fallback) | [2026-05-10-bc-light-data-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-bc-light-data-design.md) | (folded into renderer-host's `deferred_work.md`) |
| 3-6+ | Star-sphere skybox + backdrop layers | Implemented (2026-05-10; BC's StarSphere + BackdropSphere registrations driven from script through new BackdropPass) | [2026-05-10-skybox-backdrops-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-skybox-backdrops-design.md) | (folded into renderer-host's `deferred_work.md`) |
| 3-6+ | Sun rendering (procedural sphere body + corona shell) | Implemented (2026-05-10; SunPass draws textured UV-sphere at world position; corona additive shell) | [2026-05-10-sun-rendering-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-sun-rendering-design.md) | (folded into renderer-host's `deferred_work.md`) |

## Asset pipeline — known follow-ups

The asset pipeline's spec carries an 18-item deferred-work backlog covering:

- **Rendering features that need new pipeline hooks:** vertex tangent slot
  (for normal mapping), HDR texture format, LOD chain population
  (meshoptimizer-driven), continuous LOD via mesh shaders.
- **Pipeline ergonomics that grow with the renderer:** async loading, GL
  context-loss recovery, Material normalization layer, glow/specular suffix
  conventions, mod / asset-overlay support.
- **Format support beyond TGA:** PNG / DDS / BC1-7 compressed textures.
- **Cross-cutting concerns:** Phase 1 Python bindings, save/load, streaming.
- **Out-of-scope handoffs:** skinned animation playback (item 3),
  hardpoint / damage-node interpretation (item 6), particle effects
  (gap_analysis confirms procedural, not asset-pipeline), `NiBinaryVoxelData`
  semantics.

See the spec's "Deferred / future work" section for the full list with
context for each item.

## Update protocol

When a sub-project's status changes (started → in flight → implemented), or
when an item is added/removed from a deferred-work backlog, update both:

1. The spec doc's "Deferred / future work" section
2. This index, if the headline status changes
